## Installation

Use the following commands to run the project on your machine:

Backend: Open the ```.sln``` file and run the project from Visual Studio. <br />
Frontend: Run ```npm install``` in ```/src``` folder to install the required npm packages and then ```ng serve``` to run the project.

## Used technologies

For the backend I've used ```C# .NET``` and ```Entity Framework```, and for the frontend - ```Angular v.16```.
